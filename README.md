# FPOS - Price Updator
### An FPOS tool for updating prices in multiple locations via import/exporting

A small utility to facilitate simple price updates for small chains that currently do not have enterprise software. This utility will allow item prices to be exported from one location and imported into another database, retaining existing items in the database and only updating items with matching entries.
